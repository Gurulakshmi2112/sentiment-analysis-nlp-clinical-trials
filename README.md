Sentiment Analysis on Clinical Trials using NLP

This project performs sentiment analysis on clinical trial comments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

 📁 Dataset
- Contains clinical trial comments labeled as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.
- Missing values are handled and text data is preprocessed.

🧹 Preprocessing Steps
- Tokenization  
- Lowercasing  
- Removing punctuation and digits  
- Removing stopwords  
- Lemmatization  
- TF-IDF vectorization  

 🧠 Model Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- Data split: 80% training, 20% testing


📌 Project Highlights
- Simple and effective sentiment classifier.
- Useful for analyzing clinical feedback in healthcare studies.
- Built using Python, scikit-learn, and NLTK.
